CodeBeautifier
==============

CodeBeautifier prevents your code from looking like a total mess
when it comes out your Rails application.

Actually, it's impossible to make sure the generated code is always
nicely indented, so this plugin makes you and your code look smarter.

Ain't that great? :)


Basic architecture
==================

It comes out just like a regular Rack middleware in the Rails stack.
Why there? Because we must be able to intercept the response itself, 
after the processing of the controllers.


Example
=======

It's very quick to setup and enjoy. In your config/environment.rb file, just put:
[...]
Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
  [...]
  config.middleware.use "CodeBeautifier" do
    spaces        4
    content_types ["text/html", "application/xml"]
  end
  [...]
end
[...]

To Do List:
===========
* Implement the content type handling
* A real test suite (even if the code written for this middleware is very short)
